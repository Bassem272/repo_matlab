% generate a predefined number of random numbers in the range of two values in MATLAB, you can modify the `randrange` function to accept an additional input argument that specifies the number of random numbers to generate. Here is an example function that generates a specified number of random numbers in the range of two values:



% 
% r = +rand(1,  100);
r= 5+(10-5).*rand(1,100)



%This function now takes three input arguments, `a`, `b`, and `n`. The first two arguments specify the minimum and maximum values of the range, respectively, and the third argument specifies the number of random numbers to generate. The function generates `n` random integers between `a` and `b` using the `randi` function and returns them as an array.

%Here's an example of how to use the modified `randrange` function:


% Generate 5 random numbers between 1 and 10


% This will generate an array of 5 random integers between 1 and 10 (inclusive) and store it in the variable `r`.
% 
% Note that if you need to generate a random number with a non-integer value, you can modify the `randrange` function to use the `rand` function instead of `randi` and scale the output to the desired range. For example, to generate 5 random numbers between 1 and 10 with one decimal place, you can use the following code:
% 



% This will generate an array of 5 random numbers between 1 and 10 (inclusive) with one decimal place.
